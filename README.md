## Game Description 📋

**Objective**: Collect as many prizes as possible within 30 seconds <br>
**Game Board**: A 12x12 grid where prizes and traps randomly appear <br>
**Gameplay**:
* Prizes and traps appear at random positions and intervals
* Prizes and traps stay on the board for a random duration
* Clicking on a prize increases your score by 3 points
* Clicking on a trap ends the game immediately with a score of -100
* The game ends automatically after 30 seconds

## Difficulty levels 📈

The game includes four difficulty levels that affect how long prizes and traps remain on the board:

1. Easy
2. Medium
3. Hard
4. Extreme

The easier the difficulty level, the longer the prizes and traps stay on the board, making it easier to avoid
traps and collect prizes.
